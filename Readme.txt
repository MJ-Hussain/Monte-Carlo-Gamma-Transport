		Monte Carlo Simulation of a Level Range Gauge
=============================================================================
Introduction:
Nuclear level gauges employ gamma ray attenuation to monitor or controlling
the level of material in tanks in the refining and chemical industries. In
its simplest form the gauge comprises a source of radiation in a shielded 
housing and a detector. The response of the detector changes as a function of
the level of material in the tank.

Case study
Tank: Rectangular shaped with dimensions x= variable, y=200 cm, and z= 200 cm
Source: Cs-137
Medium in tank: Water and air
Water level: Variable

Setup
Source location: x=0, y=100 cm, z=100 cm
Source collimation dispersion angle = 30o
Detector dimensions: x= 3 cm, y=20 cm, z= 200 cm
Detector top center coordinates: x=tank width, y=110 cm, z= 100 cm
